2/13 - Week 1

After submitting the proposal, this week was mainly used to gather information about parts we can use and start writing the design document. We have decided to make a mail sorter that can sort mail based on images it takes, then guide the mail to the correct box using gravity. Here is our example design

Me and Angelo spent the weekend developing this dimensioned drawing so we can hand it over to the machine shop for fabrication. The mail will be held up by two acrylic pieces, then dropped through a gate into the system. The paddles will flip in the direction necessary to guide the mail to the slot. At the end, a laser break system is used to determine if the mail has crossed the threshold, and the system is ready to take in the next piece of mail.
